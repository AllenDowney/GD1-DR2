We thank the referee for a constructive report that has improved the quality of
this work. Below, we have copied the remarks from the referee (indented by >)
and have responded to each point in text that immediately follows.

* APW:
* TODO: final figure summarize data quality and dust
* Push back on Zoom-ins? -> plot them for the referee, don't add much
* TODO: send Ana file with extinction estimates

* APW: easy, but stupid

* AB: will check CMD
* Respond with plot and comment
* Main sequence becomes flatter

* AB: Punt to next paper: respond that distance not the focus
- we do lay an isochrone in fig 1, consistent with a previously reported distance and stellar population
- however, we note that fig 4 indicates a distance gradient, closer at trailing than leading tail, also consistent with the literature
- while re-deriving a distance to the stream using would be useful, it is rather involved and would need to be done along the stream, so we are leaving it for our next contribution where we will derive more general properties of GD-1, while focusing on the new features in this one

We have added a sentence to clarify how this was done.

The orbit shown in Figure 3 crosses the disk midplane (z=0) twice in the segment of the orbit shown. Given uncertainties in the Milky Way's gravitational potential, and uncertainties in the full-space motion of the stream progenitor, we don't think that including a 6-8 Gyr integration in the paper will be too meaningful. However, we have extended the integration time for the paper figure to 1 Gyr, and attach a figure with a 6 Gyr integration with this response for the referee to see.


* Comments from the AAS statistics editor:
