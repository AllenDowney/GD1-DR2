We thank the referee for these suggestions and agree that it is useful and important to discuss the quality of the astrometric solution in this region of the sky.
We have attached a figure to this report that shows maps of (1) the density of 2-parameters solutions in this region, (2) the unit weight error (as defined in Lindegren+2018, C.1), and (3) the SFD dust extinction around GD-1.
We have also computed the source density at several locations along the stream to assess whether source crowding could impact the completeness (as in Arenou+2018).
We find that, at each location along the stream between phi1 = (-50, -10) the source density is never larger than ~8000 sources/deg^2 (estimated using the 2-parameter and 5-parameter sources), and is far below the densities where crowding becomes a problem.

We don't see any correlations between astrometric issues or incompleteness and the features that we see associated with the stream.
We do, however, see density variations in the main stream track due to the scanning pattern (especially between phi1=[-80, -55]).
Given this and the above, we have added some text to Section TODO to explain this, but have decided not to add the attached figure to the text because we have instead included a new figure to address a later point (see below).

We have also looked at the magnitude of correlations between proper motion components in the selection region and found TODO.

Lastly, we have decided not to include further zoom-in panels, as our figures already contain many panels, but we have tightened the axis ranges on the proper motion panels of (what is now) Figure TODO and hope that this makes the distribution in proper-motion space clearer.

The referee is correct that the Gaia photometry is more accurate than PanSTARRS, however, at faint magnitudes (G > 18) --- the regime where GD-1 members are most easily separable from the Milky Way field stars --- the Gaia BP-RP color is much more uncertain than the PanSTARRS g-i color.
As a part of the response, we attach a figure that compares Gaia (left) and PanSTARRS (right) color-magnitude diagrams of GD-1 stars, selected within -1<phi_2<1, -50<phi_1<-10, and our fiducial proper motion selection.
Typical photometric uncertainties are shown as a function of magnitude, centered on 0 color in both panels.
PanSTARRS photometry is systematics-dominated in the entire range, and the uncertainty in both g and i bands is 0.01 mag (0.014 mag for g-i color).
Uncertainties in Gaia's G band are smaller in the entire range, but BP-RP's vary from 0.001 at G~15 to 0.05 at G~20, approximately 5 times larger than PanSTARRS at comparably faint magnitudes.
This leads to GD-1's main sequence being much better defined in PanSTARRS color-magnitude diagram than in Gaia's, so we opt to retain PanSTARRS photometry for selection of likely GD-1 members.

An isochrone at a fiducial distance to the stream is already overlaid on the GD-1 color-magnitude diagram (cmd) in Figure 1, and used to define a cmd selection box, which is very useful for improving the selection of likely GD-1 members.
Since the focus of this paper is reporting on new features of GD-1 detected in a cleaner map of the stream, using literature distance to the stream as a means to improve member selection seems adequate.
Of course, more precise distances, and hence tangential velocities, would be especially useful for dynamical modeling of GD-1, but improving on the current measurements would require a more involved calculation, so we leave it for future work where we plan to comprehensively derive stream properties in all six dimensions of the phase space.

We have added a sentence to clarify how this was done:
---
In detail, we project the solar velocity vector onto the tangent space at each star's sky position, convert to angular motion using the assumed distance, and subtract the solar component from each star's proper motion (this is done using the \package{astropy} and \package{gala} packages).

To clarify the possible association, we've changed this statement to:
---
Both the spur and the blob are close to large gaps in the stream, so a mechanism that displaces stars from their original orbits along the stream to orbits beyond the stream would explain both sets of features. Future observations of the full 3-D kinematics combined with detailed dynamical modeling of the GD-1 system will be able to test this scenario.

The orbit shown in Figure 3 crosses the disk midplane (z=0) twice in the segment of the orbit shown.
Given uncertainties in the Milky Way's gravitational potential, and uncertainties in the full-space motion of the stream progenitor, we don't think that including a 6-8 Gyr integration in the paper will be more illustrative.
However, we have extended the integration time for the paper figure to 1 Gyr, and attach a figure with a 6 Gyr integration with this response for the referee to see.

The parabolic model (in phi1, phi2) is fit to the stream ridge points, then shifted up and down to define a selection region (as described in Section 3.1).

We agree that, to characterize the stream, it would be better to build a probabilistic model of the stream in all available data dimensions.
However, to be useful for future work, this would require simultaneously modeling the phase-space density of the stream so that the variations with distance and distribution of proper motions could be taken into account in a robust way.
As the focus of this work is mainly to point out unexpected, off-track features that appear related to the stream, we defer this more sophisticated modeling to future work.



=========================================
For the journal editor:

We have addressed each of the referee's comments in the attached response, but in doing so we have added a new figure that we believe improves the paper and directly addresses one of the referee's points. We realize that now the word count is slightly over the limit for ApJ letters (we count XX words). However, we do still feel that this result and paper is in the spirit of the Letters and would like to keep it in consideration for this journal. Please let us know if we should work on trimming the text, or else please advise. Thanks!
